This year, a new kind of KeY-related event will take place for the very first time, as discussed during the KeY Symposiums in Rastatt and Gothenburg: The **HacKeYthon**.

The HacKeYthon is a two-day event with the goal of **bringing forward the development of the KeY system** and to **transfer knowledge from experienced developers to newer members and associates of the KeY project**. In particular, also students working as student assistants with KeY or writing a related Bachelor or Master thesis are cordially invited to join the event. Participants will work in small groups of 3-5 persons on one or more topics of suitable scope. Each group should consist of at least one experienced and at least one less experienced developer.

Up-to-date information about the event can be found at the [HacKeYthon web page](https://www.key-project.org/1st-hackeython-2018/).
