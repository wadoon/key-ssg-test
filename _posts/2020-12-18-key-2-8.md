After almost 2 years of active development, we present now KeY 2.8 just before the yearâ€™s end.

The new KeY version comes with significant improvements on the calculus side, but features also a major overhaul of the user interface.

We thank all contributors for reaching this milestone.

Nice holidays and a happy new year!
