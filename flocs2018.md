## KeY Version for IJCAR submission (For IJCAR 2018 Reviewers Only)

<div class="row"><div class="col-md-8">### Download or Start

KeY requires Java version 8 or newer and is tested on Linux, OS X and Microsoft Windows.

- Instant Start: [Web Start](http://formal.iti.kit.edu/key/floc-2018-pschmitt/webstart/KeY.jnlp)
- Binary Version: [KeY](http://formal.iti.kit.edu/key/floc-2018-pschmitt/key-2.7_048b77364bddfe19ccf0b766b3f1f8fcd6a43c00.zip)
- Source Code: [KeY-src.zip](http://formal.iti.kit.edu/key/floc-2018-pschmitt/key-src-2.7_048b77364bddfe19ccf0b766b3f1f8fcd6a43c00.zip)
- The [technical report](https://www.key-project.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Takeuti.pdf) contains more material than could be covered in the page resticted paper.
- The following zip-files contain proofs of the lemmas contained in the IJCAR submission [Proofs1](https://www.key-project.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Tak.zip) [Proofs2](https://www.key-project.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Tak2.zip) The files in these zip-archives use KeY internal names. The correspondence between the lemma whose proof you want to inspect and the name of the proof file can be retrieved from [Fml2Taclet](https://www.key-project.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Fml2Taclets.pdf). To inspect the proofs, start the KeY system and select in the pull-down menue “file” subitem “load” t he wanted proof file. Proof files come with extensions .key or .proof. The user will not note any difference after loading them. The .proof files contain saved finished proofs. The .key files contain commands of a simple, experimental scripting language that construct the proof on the fly.
