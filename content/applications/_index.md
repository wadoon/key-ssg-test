 Traditionally, KeY was a program verification tool for Java. Although
 this still is one of its main applications, it **grew over the years
 to a program verification platform with various fields of
 application**. The currently most prominent applications are:

- [Program Verification](/applications/program-verification/) (Standalone GUI, Eclipse Integration, KeYHoare)
- [Debugging](/applications/debugging/) (Symbolic Execution Debugger)
- [Information Flow Analysis](/applications/information-flow-analysis/) / Security
- [Test Case generation](/applications/test-case-generation/) (KeYTestGen)
 
 We are constantly working on making the KeY framework more accessible
 for other applications. For instance, it is **[quite easy to use KeY
 as a symbolic execution
 engine](https://www.key-project.org/applications/key-for-your-own-research-projects/)**
 in the backend of another tool. Ongoing work includes, for instance,
 the construction of a Java compiler based on symbolic execution trees
 created by KeY.
