### Download KeY

- Download [KeY
  2.10](https://www.key-project.org/dist/2.10.0/key-2.10.0-exe.jar) as
  single click jar and double click the jar file <small>(or use
  `java -jar key-2.8.0-exe.jar` on the command line)</small>
- Alternatively, download one of the
- [KeY 2.10.0 stable binaries](https://www.key-project.org/dist/2.10.0/key-2.10.0.zip) or
- [development versions](https://www.key-project.org/nightly/)


### Tutorials & Examples

Load an example from the list presented in the dialog that pops up when starting KeY. Good choices are, e.g.: - “Quicktour” for program verification
- “Transitivity of Subset” for first-order logic
- “Declassification – Sum” for information flow analysis

Have a look at our [tutorials
section](/applications/program-verification/#Tutorials) for program
verification. A good starting point is the [tutorial on formal
verification with
KeY](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-49812-6_16)
in the [KeY book.](/thebook2/) The [examples from the
book](/thebook2/examples-from-the-book/) are available
[here](/thebook2/examples-from-the-book/). 

### KeY as a Library

You can use KeY as a library in your own project: Make use of its
capabilities as a first-order prover or symbolic execution engine. We
provide some starting points for you in the [“KeY for Your Own
Research Projects”
section](https://www.key-project.org/applications/key-for-your-own-research-projects/).
[Download the KeY nightly source code distribution
here](http://i12www.ira.uka.de/~key/download/nightly/) and have a look
at our [Javadoc
documentation](http://i12www.ira.uka.de/~key/download/nightly/api/) if
you want to extend KeY or understand how things work under the hood.


### Getting Help

The preferred way for getting help, in particular when you want to use
KeY as a library or want to change or extend the source code, is to
use
[StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/key-formal-verification).
Be sure to tag your question with the
<kbd>key-formal-verification</kbd> tag, so that your question is not
lost amongst all the questions on StackOverflow. Alternatively, you
can write an email to our mailing list support@key-project.org.
