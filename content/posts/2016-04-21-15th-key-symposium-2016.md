The 2016 KeY symposium takes place in its 15th iteration. The [KeY](http://www.key-project.org/) System is a formal software development tool integrating design, implementation, formal specification, and formal verification of object-oriented software.   
  
At the core of the system is a theorem prover for the first-order Dynamic Logic of the respective target language, in particular Java, with a user-friendly graphical interface.

 The KeY Symposium brings together researchers interested in KeY and related aspects. We will exchange recent achievements, current ideas, discuss the next steps and milestones of the area, as well as future directions in general. Also the latest developments in the KeY tool are presented and discussed.

## Venue

 As already during the 11th Symposium in 2012, the KeY Symposium takes place at [Chalet Giersch](http://www.giersch-stiftung.tu-darmstadt.de/chalet_giersch/das_haus/das_haus.de.jsp) located in the French alps.
