Just in time to put it under your christmas tree, we are happy to present the new 2.10 version of KeY.

The new version mainly contains improvements under the hood, such as completely rewritten parsers for JML and the internal problem/proof format or better translation of problems to SMT-LIB2.

[You can download and try it out here.](https://www.key-project.org/download)

We thank all developers and testers for reaching this milestone!

Nice holidays and a happy new year!
