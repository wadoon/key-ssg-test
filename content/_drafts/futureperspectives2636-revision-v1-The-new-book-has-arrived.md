Just in time for the holiday season, the new book has arrived.

The LNCS volume 12345\* “Deductive Software Verification: Future Perspectives” contains a collection of articles <span class="aCOpRe"><span>–</span></span> reflections on the occasion of 20 years of KeY.

An account of the history of KeY is contained amongst a collection of articles on *Verification Tools*, *Contracts*, the *Feasibility and Usability* and *Integration of Verification Techniques*. The articles have been written by leading experts in the field and are not necessarily directly concerned with the KeY verification tool. They give insights to future perspectives in deductive software verification.

The book is now available at [Springer](https://www.springer.com/978-3-030-64353-9).

Many thanks to all authors for their high-quality contributions!

</sup>\* No! 12345 is not a placeholder number. It is the actual number of the volume. Pretty cool, isn't it.
