> The KeY project is a **long-term research project** started in 1998 by [Reiner Hähnle](https://www.se.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/de/se/group-members/reiner-haehnle/), Wolfram Menzel, and [Peter Schmitt](https://lfm.iti.kit.edu/pschmitt.php) at University of Karlsruhe (now Karlsruhe Institute of Technology). After Menzel’s retirement [Bernhard Beckert](https://formal.iti.kit.edu/beckert/) joined the [project leader team](https://www.key-project.org/about/people/#group-leaders) which has been unchanged ever since. (…)
> 
>  From the very first publication [\[Hähnle et al., 1998\]](http://dblp.org/rec/html/journals/ki/HahnleMS98 "DBLP") the aim of the KeY project was to **integrate formal software analysis methods**, such as formal specification and formal verification, **into the realm of mainstream software development**. This has always been—and still is—a very ambitious goal that takes a long-time perspective to realize. (…)
> 
>  From the mid 2000s onward, a number of **application scenarios for deductive verification technology beyond [functional verification](/applications/program-verification/)** have been realized on the basis of the KeY system. These include [test case generation](/applications/test-case-generation/), an [innovative debugging tool](/applications/debugging/), a [teaching](/applications/key-for-teaching/) tool for Hoare logic, and an [Eclipse extension](/applications/program-verification/#Tutorials) that integrates functional verification with mainstream software development tools. Even though they share the [same code base](/applications/key-for-your-own-research-projects/), these tools are packaged separately to cater for the different needs of their prospective users.
