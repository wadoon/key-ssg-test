### General

The 2019 KeY symposium marks the 20th Anniversary of the KeY project. The KeY System is a formal software development tool integrating design, implementation, formal specification, and formal verification of object-oriented software. At the core of the system is a theorem prover for the first-order Dynamic Logic of the respective target language, in particular Java, with a user-friendly graphical interface.

The KeY Symposium brings together researchers interested in KeY and related aspects. We will exchange recent achievements, current ideas, discuss the next steps and milestones of the area, as well as future directions in general. Also the latest developments in the KeY tool are presented and discussed.

### Book

One result of this workshop was the initiative to publish a book about the current state-of-art and future directions of software verification.

 We are happy to announce that the book “[Deductive Software Verification: Future Perspectives](https://www.springer.com/978-3-030-64353-9)” is now available for [<span aria-hidden="true" class="glyphicon glyphicon-download-alt"> download </span>](https://www.springer.com/978-3-030-64353-9) at Springer.
