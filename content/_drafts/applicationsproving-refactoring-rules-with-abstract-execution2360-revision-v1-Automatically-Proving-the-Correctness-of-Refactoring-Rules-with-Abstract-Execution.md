## Downloads

<div class="wp-block-button aligncenter is-style-squared">[<span class="tadv-color" style="color:#ffffff">Download KeY-AE</span><span class="tadv-color" style="color:#ffffff"></span>](https://www.key-project.org/material/AbstractExecution/key-2.7-AE.jar)</div>You need **at least a [Java Development Kit (JDK) 11](https://adoptopenjdk.net/)** to run the Jar above. Then, just run “`java -jar key-2.7-AE.jar`“. Have a look at the descriptions below to get started.

## Example

To see an abstract program model for the equivalence proof of a refactoring in action, download and run KeY-AE and load the example “Extract Prefix (Most General)” (see screenshot below) from the examples dialog. This will open the dialog for inspection of the model (see screenshots section further down). To edit the model, save it to another place. To load the corresponding proof obligation into KeY, hit the “Start Proof” button which will create a proof obligation in KeY. Clicking the “Play” button in the KeY main window will start proving.
