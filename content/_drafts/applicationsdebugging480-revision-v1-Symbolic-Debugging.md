</div> </div><div class="col-md-9 col-md-pull-3"> The Symbolic Execution Debugger (SED) is a platform for symbolic execution in general and allows to interactively debug programs based on symbolic execution. Symbolic execution discovers all possible execution paths simultaneously. This is achieved by the use of symbolic in lieu of concrete values resulting in a symbolic execution tree. Each node in the symbolic execution tree provides the full state and related information such as the symbolic call stack or the path conditions under which the node is reached.

 Execution can start at any method or at any statement without setting up a context. Navigation is realized using classic debugger functionality, including stepwise execution or breakpoints.
