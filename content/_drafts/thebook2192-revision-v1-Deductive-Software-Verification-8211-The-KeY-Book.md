The new book covers deductive software verification as realised by the KeY approach. It constitutes the ultimate source for the KeY tool since version 2.x.   
It also features a general (not KeY specific) chapter on the Java Modeling Language which provides a thorough introduction into the specification language.  
  
The book differs significantly to its first edition. Almost all chapters are either new or largely rewritten. It encompasses the experiences learned between the year 2006-2016.  
  
  
  
  
It is available at Springer Online (LNCS 10001)
