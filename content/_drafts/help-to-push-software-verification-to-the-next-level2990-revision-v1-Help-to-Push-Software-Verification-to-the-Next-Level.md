KeY is a world-leading deductive verification tool for Java. It has  
been used

- to find and fix serious errors and verify code of the JDK libraries   
    ([TimSort](http://www.envisage-project.eu/proving-android-java-and-python-sorting-algorithm-is-broken-and-how-to-fix-it/), [Dual Pivot Quicksort](https://www.key-project.org/2017/08/17/dual-pivot/) and [LinkedList](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-45237-7_13)),
- [to find and fix bugs in IntelliJ’s refactoring tool](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-271801),
- and to [verify parts of Norway’s Governmental Election Software](https://www.key-project.org/2020/10/06/norwegian-governmental-election-software-formally-verified-with-key/).

The next step is to improve KeY’s usability and performance to a  
degree that puts it in reach of the average software developer. We  
have some great ideas on how to achieve this, and we obtained a  
coveted [Research Grant for Sustainable Software from DFG](https://www.dfg.de/foerderung/info_wissenschaft/2016/info_wissenschaft_16_71/index.html) (the German  
Science Foundation).

## Now all we need is: you!
