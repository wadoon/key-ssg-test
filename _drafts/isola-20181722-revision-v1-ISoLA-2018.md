<div class="row"><div class="col-md-3 col-md-push-9">  </div><div class="col-md-9 col-md-pull-3"> <span aria-hidden="true" class="glyphicon glyphicon-info-sign"></span> This page supplies additional material for the reviewers of the paper “*Automatically Proving the Correctness of Compilation Rules*“, submitted to [ISoLA 2018](http://www.isola-conference.org/).

 The [extended technical report](TODO-TR-LINK) based on the ISoLA paper can be found [here](TODO-TR-LINK). The technical report additionally contains material that we had to leave out in the submission for space reasons. For convenience, we also created a [PDF file visualizing the difference between the technical report and the submission](TODO-DIFF-LINK) (parts highlighted in blue are only contained in the technical report, while parts highlighted in yellow are only contained in the submission).

## TBD
