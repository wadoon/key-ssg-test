This page contains the KeY version used for the evaluation as well as an archive with the [examples](https://www.key-project.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Examples.zip).

- [KeY distribution](https://www.key-project.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/key-2.7_21922ea4bda81e9515d1cbd01d04f2091992204d.zip): You need Java 12 to run this version of KeY
- [Examples](https://www.key-project.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Examples.zip)

Download the [KeY distribution](https://www.key-project.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/key-2.7_21922ea4bda81e9515d1cbd01d04f2091992204d.zip) and unpack it in a directory of your choice. Start KeY by clicking on `KeY.jar` (or by` java -jar KeY.jar` on the command line). Download then the [examples](https://www.key-project.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Examples.zip) and extract them into a directory, e.g., `examples`

In KeY you can now load the examples via menu File | Load â€¦ When you select the files ending with .proof you get the closed (and open) proofs reported in the evaluation section. You can also load the .key files to load the proof obligation and perform the proofs by yourself.
