<div style="background-color: #ffbd22; padding: 5px 10px;">Please **use the “Publications” menu item** in the side bar, **do not edit the publication *page***.

You can **import existing BibTeX entries** via “Publications &gt; Import / Export”.

Make sure that under “Data options &gt; Author/Editor format” the correct format or “Dynamic Detection” is chosen.

The BibTeX **“keywords” field is also imported**, the respective entries are **converted into WordPress tags**. Please make sure that **your tags / keywords contain at least one tag of the following list**, whenever applicable:

**“Verification”, “Debugging”, “Secure Information Flow”, “Teaching”, “Test Case Generation”**.

This makes sure that your publications also appear in the specific category pages and not only in the general publications list.
