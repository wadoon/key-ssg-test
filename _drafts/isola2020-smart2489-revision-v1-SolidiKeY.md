After unpacking SolidiKeY can be started by double-clicking on the jar file called <span>*key-2.7-exe.jar* or via the command line `java -jar key-2.7-exe.jar`</span>

Once SolidiKeY has started, go to menu `File > Load`and load one of the `.key` files below the directory `input.` The directory contains two subdirectories called `withCallBack` and `withoutCallBack`. They contain the input files with a directive that indicates which of the transfer semantics to use.

You can start the verification by clicking the green arrow button in the left toolbar.

**Requirements.** Java 12 installed.

**Note:** If you have or had KeY installed before, you need to delete or rename the `.key` directory in your home directory.
