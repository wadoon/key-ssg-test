 </div><div class="col-md-9 col-md-pull-3">The 2018 KeY symposium marks its 17th iteration and this year the symposium makes its return to Göteborg, Sweden. The KeY System is a formal software development tool integrating design, implementation, formal specification, and formal verification of object-oriented software. At the core of the system is a theorem prover for the first-order Dynamic Logic of the respective target language, in particular Java, with a user-friendly graphical interface.

The KeY Symposium brings together researchers interested in KeY and related aspects. We will exchange recent achievements, current ideas, discuss the next steps and milestones of the area, as well as future directions in general. Also the latest developments in the KeY tool are presented and discussed.

### Venue

The symposium takes place at the [Chalmersska huset](https://www.chalmersskahuset.se), also known as [The house of William Chalmers](https://www.chalmers.se/en/about-chalmers/house%20of%20william%20chalmers/Pages/default.aspx)).
