  </div><div class="col-md-9 col-md-pull-3"> The 2017 KeY symposium takes place in its 16th iteration. The KeY System is a formal software development tool integrating design, implementation, formal specification, and formal verification of object-oriented software. At the core of the system is a theorem prover for the first-order Dynamic Logic of the respective target language, in particular Java, with a user-friendly graphical interface.

 The KeY Symposium brings together researchers interested in KeY and related aspects. We will exchange recent achievements, current ideas, discuss the next steps and milestones of the area, as well as future directions in general. Also the latest developments in the KeY tool are presented and discussed.

##  Venue 

 The symposium takes place at the [Bildungshaus St. Bernhard](http://st-bernhard-rastatt.de) in Rastatt under the special protection of St. Bernhard von Baden.
