In 2018, a new type of KeY-related event takes place for the very first time: The HacKeYthon. The goal of this happening is to **bring together experienced KeY developers**, **new project members** and associates as well as **interested students** which in small groups tackle several interesting **programming projects related to KeY** in a nice and productive setting. Thus, at the same time we can **bring forward the development of the KeY framework** as well as **transfer valuable knowledge** to the next generation of KeY developers.

The HacKeYthon is an invitation-only event. If you are interested in participating but have not been invited yet, please contact Dominic Steinhöfel (see [people page](https://www.key-project.org/about/people/) for contact details). Also for other questions or concerns feel free to drop an email.

Information about the registration will be published here after the public feedback deadline.

The HacKeYthon will take place in Karlsruhe (KIT). We will send more concrete information to registered participants after expiration of the registration deadline.

For information about the list of topics offered and associated team speakers, please visit our dedicated [HacKeYthon topics page](https://www.key-project.org/1st-hackeython-2018/1st-hackeython-topics/).
